      <li>24 pitted dates</li>
      <li>4 ounces honey-flavored goat cheese, softened</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon minced fresh rosemary</li>
      <li>8 slices bacon, cut into thirds crosswise</li>
      <li>24 toothpicks</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet
        with aluminum foil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Using a paring knife, cut each date lengthwise through to the middle.
        Combine goat cheese and rosemary in a bowl until evenly mixed. Stuff
        each date with the goat cheese mixture. Wrap each date with a small
        piece of bacon and secure with a toothpick. Place on prepared baking
        sheet.
      </li>
      <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes.</li>
      <li>
        Turn on the broiler and place baking sheet 6 inches from heat. Broil
        until bacon is browned and slightly crispy, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from
        oven and place on a serving platter; drizzle dates with hot honey.
